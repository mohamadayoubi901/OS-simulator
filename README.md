# OS-simulator
This project aims to implement an OS basic simulation application that interacts with the 
user through asking him/her for two sets of basic information: initial hardware resources that can  be used,
then continuously information to schedule and execute few processes. As executions are  requested, 
the simulation should be showing him/her the process states and the corresponding  hardware status at certain time intervals.
